Features:

For the front end development:

Frontend Technology Stack:

React.js: The front end of the Expense Tracker website is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI elements, making development more efficient.


HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content of the website. It provides the foundation for displaying text, images, forms, and other elements on web pages.
CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements, defining their appearance, layout, and presentation. It allows for customization of fonts, colors, spacing, and other visual aspects of the website.


Component-based Architecture:

React.js follows a component-based architecture, where each UI element is encapsulated within a component. This modular approach makes it easier to manage and reuse code, resulting in a more organized and maintainable codebase.

State Management:

React.js utilizes a concept called "state" to manage the data and UI state of components. State allows components to dynamically update and rerender in response to user interactions or changes in data.
Routing:

React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different pages or views within the Expense Tracker website without the need for full page reloads. This creates a smoother and more responsive user experience.

Styling with CSS:

CSS is used to style the components and layout of the Expense Tracker website, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design. CSS rules can be applied directly to React components using inline styles or defined in external CSS files and imported into the project.

By leveraging these technologies and best practices, the front end of the Expense Tracker website provides a user-friendly interface for managing expenses and accessing valuable financial insights.
